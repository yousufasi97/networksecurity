#  Network Security ML Pipeline with FastAPI, Docker, and AWS EC2  

###  About this Project  
This project is my attempt to bring together **machine learning and practical cybersecurity** â€” building an intelligent system that can automatically detect **phishing and malicious network activity**.  
It started as a simple data-processing experiment but evolved into a **fully functional MLOps pipeline** powered by FastAPI, Docker, MongoDB, and GitHub Actions, and finally deployed on **AWS EC2**.  

The system can train itself on raw network data, validate and transform the inputs, and deploy a machine-learning model that predicts security threats in real time through an API endpoint.
